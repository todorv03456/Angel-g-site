<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: larger;">Proof of Work Explained</p>
<br>

<!-- Another message -->


<div style="font-size: large;" class="container">
<p>Proof of work. This is the core of everything we do in the Pro Trading Program. It is not for me, it is for you. If you commit to proving the work that you have done and actually following this program, you will become the person you want to be.</p>
<p>So, how exactly do you prove your work? There are multiple ways in which it can be done. The number one thing you need to focus on is completing your daily tasks every day in order and not missing a day. If you do that, it is impossible for you to fail the proof of work section.</p>
<p>You must complete the core lessons, that is done day by day. You do not need to keep a track of it because I have a system, as you go through from day one all the way to day 30. You will complete all of the core lessons in order. When they're all complete, you'll be given a role.</p>
<p>That role will be one of the criteria that allows you to go to Level 2 belt. Completing the assignments that go along with the core lessons is again something you should do every day. There is a channel inside the Level 1 belt program, which is called Level 1 lessons.</p>
<p>In the Level 1 belt lessons channel, you can ask for advice on the lesson specifically. Assignments are extremely important. Trading is not learned from a book, it is learned by doing. We're going to be doing many many things to apply these Trading Lessons to the charts from pattern recognition, challenges to specific trading challenges and a whole host more.</p>
<p>Following these every day and showing that you've done the work is a key part of you getting promoted. Second, you must complete 4 weeks of goal crushers with a 7 out of 10 pass rate and proof uploaded. This is a criteria that can only be approved and verified by myself. What you need to do very simply is go every Sunday night or Monday morning to the goal crushers channel, upload your weekly goals and your weekly tasks.</p>
<p>Then come back on Sunday night after your seven days and review it. Give yourself an honest score. There is no point lying to yourself here. There's no point lying to me. You know what the pass rate needs to be.</p>
<p>I've not set it that way so you can cheat your way through this because you're only cheating yourself. You need to do at least four weeks passing 7 out of 10. If you fail one week, you must start again. It's a four week streak that is required to go through.</p>
<p>There will be a portal that opens up after you have completed your first four weeks that allows you to enter your proof of work for goal crushers at which point I will review it and approve it. Third, you must verify your test system in the channel Level 1 belt systems. Very simple. Whenever we get to the testing phase, you will build a system and you will have it feedback and approved by myself.</p>
<p>You will be shown exactly how to make it, you will then make it. I will approve it and then you can begin backtesting. Once you get approved I'll give you a role that verifies you have a system that is one of the criteria to go through to Level 2 belt. And finally number four, you must complete your 100 backtests with proof and submit them to me.</p>
<p>Again, a portal will open up where you can share your 100 backtests. I'll show you exactly how to share it, exactly how to do it and you will get approval by me to get promotion to Level 2 belt once that plus the other three criteria are met. That's it. That is proof of work. Now, every day from day one all the way to the very end, which we don't know when that's going to be yet.</p>
<p>The plan is to be here for as long as possible, to make as much progress as possible, as much money as possible and become the person you want to be. So from day one until whenever, you will always have daily tasks to do. Those daily tasks are your responsibility. You must mark them as part of your morning plan and end of day review. You are solely responsible for tracking these throughout the day.</p>
<p>If you're not doing morning plan and end of the review, which takes 10 minutes. If you're not doing that, you're not going to make it. So, make sure you do that. You follow those tasks, you complete them, check them off and add them to your end of day review. That's where they need to be.</p>
<p>Without being sad, that's everything about proof of work for Level 1 belt and beyond. Now, let's get into it.</p>
