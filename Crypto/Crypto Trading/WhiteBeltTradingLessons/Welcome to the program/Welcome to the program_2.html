<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: large;">An overview of Level 1 Belt and the things you must do for promotion to Level 2 Belt.</p>
<br>


<!-- Another message -->
<div style="text-align: center;  font-size: large;">
    <p>Your goal, your one and only goal as a Level 1 belt is to prove consistency. Consistency comes first through consistency as a person, not as a trader. You must become a consistent person with ingrained habits and discipline before you can then move on to becoming a consistent trader and then beyond that, you can become consistently profitable.</p>
    <p>No live trading is required in the Level 1 belt stage. The good habits that you're going to build, they form outside of the trading screen. This is very important. I know everybody wants to rush and go fast and get through things as quickly as possible and they think that that's the quickest way to progress, and everything can be done faster, faster, faster.</p>
    <p>NOT in the markets. The markets will eat you up and spit you out if you do not respect them and the best way to build that is to build yourself into somebody who is indestructible in the markets. Inside Level 1 Belt, you're going to learn the process of learning. Many of you will have never done this, some of you will have done it when you were in school and then forgotten all about it. You're going to be shown how to effectively study and apply the lessons.</p>
    <p>This is not like school where you just do it to tick a box or finish a quiz or pass an exam. This is for you. This isn't for me, this isn't for some Board of Governors, it's for you. So you're going to learn how to actually make your own life better through trading. You'll learn how to set goals and achieve them, the positive reinforcement and dopamine hacks that can allow you to get pleasure out of achieving anything and how you get pleasure from hard work.</p>
    <p>You'll learn how to create trading rules, building simple systems and how to test your idea and make it real. Level 1 belt is not all about just doing habits and just doing repetitive tasks. You are going to be in active on the charts doing the lessons in the order I prescribed them and you will be building a system, you will be backtesting. You must start from a fundamental core of learning before you go live on trading.</p>
    <p>I have mentored and coached many people and a really key failure point I see in all of them is that they didn't do enough learning before going live. Many people start live trading with real money before they have ever even done a single backtest. That is ridiculous. And that is not going to happen to you because you're going through the Pro Trader Program.</p>
    <p>So, what tasks should a Level 1 belt do? You should read the Discord channels every day that are available to you. If I'm there, one on one giving you advice on whatever stage you're at in the Level 1 belt journey, you should be taking advantage of that. You must study the core lessons in order. It's laid out day by day. Each day has more than enough work for you to do.</p>
    <p>You will see as you go through, this is not a process that can be shortcutted. Doing it one day at a time will give you the most effective and valuable experience that you could have. You've joined this program and proven that you're a committed, you must now commit to what The Pro Trader Program is. If you think you can do it better, you're more than welcome to. But that defeats the purpose of having joined the program.</p>
    <p>Study the lessons in order, do the tasks I tell you to do on the day as I tell you to do them because you're drawing on all of my experience and you're getting the fastest most efficient path to profit. Level 1 must also complete goal crushers every week. More details will be revealed in the day one lessons coming up right after this. You'll create a simple system and you'll complete 100 backtests.</p>
    <p>The promotion criteria for progression to Level 2 belt. Well, as I said at the start, and as you've seen before, The Program is all about proof of work. You must complete the core lessons and the assignments with them. You must complete 4 weeks of goal crushers with a 7 out of 10 pass rate and proof uploaded. Meaning you must use goal crushers every week to set your weekly goals. Lay them out, set down what your goals are, what your rewards are, and you must grade yourself each week honestly on that scoring 7 out of 10 or better to pass each week 4 verified weeks equals a pass for that part of the program.</p>
    <p>Third, you must have created a test system and had it verified. We have a special channel for that - level 1 belt systems. Once you go through the systems lessons, which are coming later on in the Level 1 belt program, you will know what to do. You then do that, I will help you by verifying your system. When I verify you with a correct system, I will give you a role. You will receive a special role that shows me that you have done it and you've met one of the criteria to be promoted. You must then complete 100 backtests with proof.</p>
    <p>Again, you will be shown exactly how to do this. And again it will be assessed by me personally and finally, promotion to Level 2 belt combination of all the tasks to complete along the way. When I personally have verified that you've done all of those, and I am happy with your progress. I will award you to Level 2 belt and you move on to the next stage of the program.</p>
    <p>Promotion time. So, many of you have trading experience, some of you will be on day one. Some of you will have one hour a day to spare to learn trading, some of you will have 10 hours a day. Whatever your path is, is your path. There is no defined time by which you can become a Level 5 belt.</p>
    <p>It is different for everyone. Your progress depends on your journey, do not compare yourself to others or me. The one and only rule in the entire program is that Level 1 belt cannot be passed in under 30 days. After that you can progress as fast or as slow as you want. But the minimum requirement for everyone in Level 1 belt is 30 days. That is because the goal of Level 1 belt is to prove consistency.</p>
    <p>For you to prove consistency, you must do certain things a number of times over and over and over again to show me that you can follow those plans, follow those processes, follow those systems. To me, that is 30 days it takes 30 days to build a habit. Level 1 is designed to build the habits of a successful person. Therefore, after 30 days, you're eligible to progress. So, that's the Level 1 overview. Click through now. And let's get right into it.</p>
