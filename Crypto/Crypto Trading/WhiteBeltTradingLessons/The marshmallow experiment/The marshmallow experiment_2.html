<div style="text-align: center;  font-size: large;">
<p>The marshmallow experiment is a famous study from back in the 1970s. In this experiment young kids were placed in a room with a marshmallow and given a choice, they can either eat the marshmallow right away or wait for 15 minutes without eating it and if they did that, they'd receive a second marshmallow as a reward for being patient. So that's pretty basic experiment at the beginning. But what happened then was the researchers followed these children throughout their life. </p>
<p>Followed them into later life and found that those who were originally able to wait tend to have better life outcomes in all areas. Better grades in school, making more money in their jobs, building better businesses, living healthier lifestyles and generally having better social skills, and just being an all around better person. The study was a test of delayed gratification. Many of you are gamers. And even if you're not a gamer, because I wouldn't class myself as a gamer, but I played video games as a kid. I'm sure everyone did at some point.</p>
<p>How many times did you complete story mode on a game and then just reset it back to the start, and do it all over again? I know I did. Because what would it be like if you could only play the last level of a game? After story mode is all completed. Would that still be fun? Running around on GTA with millions of dollars, no missions to complete, it's shit, right? There's a reason why when you use all the cheat codes in GTA you have fun for about 25 minutes and then you're bored. Because you haven't earned it. You haven't learned, you haven't figured out the rules of the game, you've haven't had to develop skills within the game, you haven't had to put in time and effort and energy to reach that level. </p>
<p>So if you just use the infinite money glitch and got everything you wanted, you'd have fun for a little bit. But what happened if your parent came in, reset the game, turn it off, wasn't saved. You have to start again. Back to zero, back to the start. You wouldn't know how to get to that previous level because you didn't put in the work. And most importantly, you didn't delay gratification. The thing that makes winning so sweet is the journey to get there. You have to face challenges, you have to overcome challenges. That is how you build a skill. </p>
<p>You cannot get better at something without first failing at it. If everything you did went perfectly well on the first try, life wouldn't be very interesting, you wouldn't develop much as a person and if you actually did that, you will probably be doing things that are absolutely zero benefit to you. Because anything that's worth having comes to those who put in the work and commit to learning. The best things take time and effort. That goes for any game, any skill, anything in life. It's normal and it's something that you must embrace. </p>
<p>Because if you don't embrace the journey and you don't learn those important skills, you won't know how to live like the person you think you want to be. So let's imagine you want to be rich or be a millionaire. That's generally the goal of everyone or most people. But the past bull market and the stories you've seen and heard of people who made crazy money on a shitcoin pump on Shiba or some NFT is a perfect example. I've met more of these guys than you have. I can guarantee that. You can have the money, but you don't know how to live like a rich person. </p>
<p>I'll tell a quick story. I went to special event last year. And there were many of us (my team), but there was a small group of many new rich guys, mostly crypto rich who had been rich for less than a year. And the the event was based around how to live like a rich person. How to carry yourself in high society. How to be a high status man, how to be a high status person. How to mingle with the top tiers of society without looking out of place. So of course, as the event would be, it was amazing. It was enlightening. It was eye opening. It was incredible. </p>
<p>But the thing that stood out to me was that at the end, one of the guys thanked the person who ran the event. And when he did so he said ''I've had rich guy money for a while now, but the past months following your advice have taught me how to be a rich guy.'' You can have the money, you can have the success on paper, you can have the status. But if you haven't earned it, you're still going to have to go back and learn how to live like that person. You think the destination is the goal, but it's not. </p>
<p>Because whenever you get to whatever your initial big goal is, you're going to move the goalposts higher and bigger and better and you should. That's normal as part of being a human, you climb on mountain, you immediately look at the next mountain and the point of this is that you should not skip any step along the way. There will come a time in your life when you can never be poor again. When you can never go back to having no responsibility when you can never go back to being a beginner. When you can never go back to being the age you are now. </p>
<p>And in those times, you're going to look back and say ''The journey really was the best part. Michael was right. Everyone who has ever told me this, they were all right.'' I don't look back at when I was younger and think ''Oh, if I'd have done this and done that, I could have done it faster.'' I don't regret anything. Because everything's easy In hindsight, it's just like trading. Every trade is easy in hindsight. So while I could have held on a bit longer and got more profit or I could have caught that one before the drop and save money. Everyone's hindsight portfolio is 11 fingers, right?</p>
<p>What you'll do along the way is you'll realize so much more about yourself by going through adversity. Some people have adversity thrust upon them, most people really at some point in your life. This is one of the best things I ever learned from George is that every day you are happy. You can just be different grades of happy. Happiness is more of a spectrum. It's not something that you are or you are not. You're either happy or extremely happy and very occasionally in your life, when tragic things happen, you will be sad. </p>
<p>But if there aren't tragic things, if tragedy doesn't strike you, you are happy, even if you don't feel like it, you must be and you must be grateful that you are not forcibly sad, because those days will come for all of us. So, you have to embrace that. You have to embrace the journey. And if the hardest thing for you is to fucking sit down and do 100 back test or read all the Trading Lessons and actually internalize the knowledge. Not read them so that they're done and you can tick that box and say ''I completed the lessons''.</p>
<p>The lessons are not there as a checkbox exercise. You're not in school, you're in something better than school. You're in a interactive mentorship program. You're supposed to take the learnings and apply them. And if it doesn't make sense, that's fine. Because the complex things in life that truly give you an edge that push you from zero to one are difficult to understand. If they weren't, they wouldn't have value.</p>
<p>You know that 90% of people lose and it makes them losers in life. They lose not because they're dumber than you, not because they had less opportunity than you. They lose simply because they quit. They quit because they're lazy or they quit because they don't have the perspective that I'm trying to give you through everything we do here. They don't have the perspective that you're not actually losing. You're on your way to success as long as you're getting 1% better every day. </p>
<p>You cannot define the moment at which you achieve what you want. You cannot force that upon the universe. But if you put out an intention of what you wanna achieve and you have a clear path that has been trodden before by people who have what you want and you take the steps that are required every day, you will reach there. You simply will. But you can't say, ''well, this guy or that guy made a million dollars from zero in two years. Therefore, I must do it in two years.'' What kind of logic is that? Because what if you get to two years and you've got 100 grand, and you start with 1,000? That is insane fast and solid progress.</p>
<p>So would you actually quit after two years because this arbitrary date you set? It could only take you another six months to get to a million. So, why would you quit after two years? Nobody would. In that example none of you will quit after two years. So why would you start your journey saying I need to have X amount of money by X date or I feel like a failure. A failure of what? You're still going to wake up every morning. Every morning you wake up is another blessed day.</p>
<p>It's another day you should be grateful for and you should be grateful to get to work on your goals and not be forced to work in a fucking labor camp or be forced to do things against your will like many people in the world are, or forced by circumstance to never even have a remote possibility of making it. Not even having an internet connection. So, to take all this background to making it in the next Bull Run or in any market. You very very simply need to have a clear goal and clear steps to get there, and like the story at the start, you need to be the kid who waits 15 minutes and doesn't eat that marshmallow as soon as it's in front of him. </p>
<p>How can you do it? How can you use delayed gratification to your advantage? By joining the new Pro Trader Program which launches this Thursday. The Program is going to take you from wherever you are now to massive success before the next Bull Run. I will not tell you that you're going to make any certain amount of money because that will be disingenuous, but I can absolutely 100% guarantee you that if you follow the program and you invest in it your time and energy. It is impossible for you to not be much much much further ahead in two years than you are now.</p>
<p>It's impossible for you not to have success. Because anything you do in life that is to a plan and it has a purpose behind it, and that has verified results from others, you can only get better. The Program for anyone who hasn't heard about it is going to be a step by step, month by month, week by week, day by day guide for how to get the most out of the Trading Lessons and how to get more out of yourself as a person. Because guess what? </p>
<p>The person who makes all the money in the market and keeps it is not the one who understands Wycoff theory the best. It's not the one who discovers the magic of trend lines. It's not even the one with the best risk management. Because risk management protecting your downside is nothing without exploiting the upside. You must first become the type of person who like my friend doesn't just get rich but knows how to be rich, how to be a rich person. </p>
<p>So on Thursday, anyone who chooses and it is a choice. I do not want anybody inside my Program that is not committed. Anyone who chooses to join the Program will become a Level 1 belt. They will be blessed with the new role, the white roll the white name, and a learning tag. And your goal within the Level 1 belt system is to prove consistency. Consistency does not mean profits. In fact, it has nothing to do with trading. It has nothing to do with live trading anyway. You must prove consistency to yourself as well as me in order to progress. </p>
<p>There are a number of interactive challenges involved with the Level 1 belt system. The full details of which of course will be revealed on Thursday. But I want to give you a little sneak peek and insight into it. You will learn how to become a consistent person because believe it or not, the markets and life are not separate. The markets are the best reflection of human emotions that we have anywhere on the planet. The truest form of what the collective mind of humans all across the globe is expressed through financial markets. </p>
<p>That's the purest expression of what the world is thinking and most important what they're doing. It's very easy to talk a big game on Twitter or on YouTube, or to your friends, or to your family. But when it comes down to it and you put money on the line, that's when you see how people are really behaving. And inevitably, when the cycles come and go, the old saying that when the tide goes out, you find out who was swimming naked. That shows who was prepared for this new wealth that will be given up to them who wasn't. Because guess what? </p>
<p>When the bull run comes, everyone has the opportunity to get rich. But there's a big difference between paper profits and realize profits. There are many people who had 10, 20, 50, 100, 200x their current net worth 12 or 18 months ago and they do not have it now. Getting it is good but keeping it, those are the winners of the game. So, you are absolutely welcome to absorb the lessons as I put them out and all the new lessons which are coming, many new lessons coming this week as well by the way, a lot of advanced lessons too. You are free to do whatever you wish. But if you want to be the person who keeps the money at the end of the next cycle, The Pro Trader Program is your way to do it. </p>
<p>That is your best chance. You're all here to learn, you're all here to learn something. You wouldn't be paying to me without the desire to learn. You've already proven that you're not stupid, you're smart. You've chosen to be in the right place, you made the important first step. Now I'm offering you a direct path, the shortest way to the success you actually want. Now, when I say shortest way, some of you will have unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>You might think the short way, ''Michael is gonna tell me the tricks the secrets of the market and I'm gonna get rich in three months.'' No, you're not. I could show you a path that would take three years and that would be infinitely faster than anyone who just slapped around and yolo at the shitcoins, and gets paper rich, and then spent the next 20 years talking about how they had 3 million at one point. And now they've got 100 grand or less, maybe nothing or a bunch of shitcoins that are just sitting in a Metamask wallet as dust. </p>
<p>So, no matter who you are you start as a White Belt. I don't care if you've made millions in the market. You must prove consistency to pass. And yes, you're proving it to me, because the only person who hands out the Level 2 (Blue Belt) is me. It's my call and my call only every single time at the end of everyone's Level 1 belt journey. And for all that, I know many of you, I know some of you quite well. It is still the burden of performance is on you. I do all of this to help you of course and I want everyone to make it, but you must also be hungry to prove to yourself.</p>
<p>If you think you're beyond Level 1 (White Belt) then it should be easy to crush Level 1 Belt, right? Take your ego and use it positively. So, little peeks of what's coming... Multiple challenges. So, how do you pass? The question on everyone's lips. How do you pass Level 1 belt? The way you go through the program in true crypto style. You all know I'm a big Bitcoin bull. Everything you do along the program journey is going to be about proof of work. You have to show me. Words mean nothing. Actions are what determine how far you go in this program. </p>
<p>There are specific tasks. Anyone who's in goal crushers knows that the only way to achieve anything is to make it a quantifiable number. I have to read X number of articles. I have to submit X number of strategies. I have to do a fixed number of things to equal success. 100 backtests, $31 trades, whatever it may be. Аll of that stuff is coming along the way. The proof of work is how you progress. There are no handouts because handouts are not good for you. I know what is good for you. The thing that is good for you is the thing that is hard and the thing you don't want to do, the thing the bitch inside you wants to skip. But guess what? </p>
<p>Everyone who fails, skips that shit. Everyone who makes it, embraces it. So, Level 1 belt is all about habits. And building any habit more important than anything else. The single most important way to build a habit is through time and repetitions. You need reps. To build a habit you need to brush your teeth every day, you must do it for many many days, you must brush your teeth twice over and over and over again. Yes, the reps matter. But you can't just shortcut it and say, if I need to do 100 trades, I'm gonna go on to the 30 sec chart and blast out 100 backtests in a day. Time matters too. </p>
<p>You all know this. And for many of you this will simply serve as a reminder, for some of you this will be brand new. But as you go through the program you will realize that it is not about getting to the destination as quickly as possible. It's about that feeling of waking up for many, many, many, many, many days and weeks in a row and doing the same thing over and over again. Until one day you wake up you're like ''oh, shit, I didn't even think about that today I just did it. It was just like brushing my teeth, I just did it. I've just built a habit'' and not a destructive habit like most habits in life, I've built a positive habit. </p>
<p>And then you get that wave of excitement wash over you as you move on to build the next positive habit. And then you stack those habits on top of each other. So, your goal as a Level 1 belt is to prove consistency. Every requirement to pass and there are six requirements to pass or six steps I should say are all about building positive habits because if you can build the discipline to start and build the positive habits at every stage. After that becomes easier and easier and easier. The time it takes to go from Level 1 belt to Level 2 belt will be the toughest. </p>
<p>It will be the most challenging it will be the possibly even the longest in terms of days and weeks for you. But it is the most important step that is the leap you make from zero to one. And from there, you stack on top of that exponentially. Get faster and faster and faster and better and better and better because you've built a solid core. If you don't have a solid core, you are doomed to fail. If anyone has trained here. If anyone has done powerlifting or any type of weightlifting or even any type of really any skill or any martial art. </p>
<p>The most neglected but the most important thing in the human body for exercise for performance is your core, it all comes from a core. You're not gonna be great boxer, if you don't have any balance. Balance comes from your core, your footwork, your movement, how you actually move around. The very basic fundamentals. If you want to do a lat pulldown in the gym, you don't just yank at it and use your arms, you engage your core, first of all, so you can actually isolate the muscle that is doing the pulling. Build your core first before you start to add on the supplementary work. </p>
<p>It will take you all the way from zero right through building positive habits, how to set goals and crush them every week, you will go through the core Trading Lessons. The lessons as you know them right now, for anyone who joins the program, they're going to be reformatted. They're going to be placed into order not just upon the sector that talk about not just the specific types of technical analysis or mindset, they're going to be put into order. The first thing you will learn are the core lessons the most know. </p>
<p>The fundamentals that you have to ingrain in your consciousness to pass through to the Level 2 system. You will learn about the art of trading, you will learn about the process of mechanical trading as a systematic trader. You will learn the act of trading. Because for anyone who doesn't know, there are two parts to the game of trading, there was one which is the act of trading the physical execution of a system following rules and then there is the speculation on top. And of course, as you all know, whether you admit it or not.</p>
<p>Everybody, pretty much everybody skips the first part goes straight to the second part, they have it the wrong way around. And that's why they're doomed to fail. You learn how to trade first, then you add size. And once you've completed your five measurable tasks, six in total but they become clearly here are five measurable tasks, which will then be assessed to you either through a quiz, or directly through myself. You will be granted roles, the roles are your progress along the way. </p>
<p>The only way you can get granted a Level 2 belt by me is if you have the required roles in your Discord profile. So three, four weeks from now, I'll be able to click on any one of your profiles and see how close you are to being a Level 2 belt. Time is the most important thing about this. Everybody can go from Level 1 belt to Level 5 belt. The time taken will vary. You must accept that now. I'm not here to bullshit you. I'm here to tell you the truth. The truth is the things that you really want are at the end of the things you don't want to do, the hard shit, the shit that makes everyone else quit and cancel their subscriptions. </p>
<p>And that's not just for my program, I'm talking about life in general. The shit that makes people give up. At times is going to suck, but that's the point. A times life sucks, but do you quit? Do you give up? Of course not. The skill you are learning by the way, although this is framed and anyone who's here right now is so lucky. You're so lucky because actually, I'm going to write this launch this first time with very specific timeframes in mind because you are far enough away from the next Bull Run to actually be able to implement all of this before we reach that peak euphoria where the big big money is made. </p>
<p>You actually have the luxury of time, you have 12 to 24 months. But the skill you're learning is a lifetime skill. Other things come and go. Trends come and go. Industries come and go. The markets are eternal. If you learn how to manage your own money whether that's short term or long term. If you learn how to be a consistently profitable trader over time over your lifetime, which should be 40, 50, 60,70 years for everyone here. God willing or longer, hundreds of years hopefully. You'll make so much money that you can book and buy a new everything. </p>
<p>Although I don't know how I will feel about that philosophically, myself personally. But whatever you want to do. The skill of trading is with you for life. For life. The most important skill I ever learned in my life was sales. I don't work in sales anymore but it carries over everything I do. A lot of people say that I speak well, very convincing. That all comes from my sales background. Every day when I'm in the chats and I'm writing messages, I know how to make them appealing and engaging from sales. But also more importantly, the reason why it's most important thing I've learned is because I always know in the back of my head, no matter what happens, no matter what misfortune befalls me, nobody can take away from me my ability to sell. </p>
<p>And it's the most bankable skill that you could have. And I always know that I can go back and do sales if I need to. Trading will be the same for you. Trading is the next iteration of that in my life and hopefully for everyone here. 20 years from now, the market will be the same. How do I know? Because 600 years ago it was the same. 500 years 400, 300, 100. The market never changes. It evolves, it looks different to the naked eye. But the concept of how to multiply your wealth never changes. It's all about compound interest. </p>
<p>So, even if it took you 10 years to learn how to trade profitably. You've learned a skill for the rest of your life. But I'm gonna give you a path that's much faster than that. It's not gonna be three months, right? It's not gonna be 10 years. If you do the things I say, you can significantly decrease the learning curve. And if that wasn't enough the challenges you're going to face are going to improve you as a person. You're going to do things that are difficult, you're going to have tight deadlines that you think you're not going to make. And then you got to stay open, you're gonna grind and you're gonna make them, аnd the next time something comes along that's under time pressure, you're gonna think, wait, I crushed that I crushed that deadline three weeks ago. I can do this. Yeah, fuck it. Alright, I'm not sleeping tonight but boom, I'm gonna do it and bang, you do it. </p>
<p>You become a winner, you become a doer, you become someone who sets out to do something and does it. And here's the reality. This skill is a lifetime skill. But everybody else is a loser and a quitter. There was a good comment in the chat today from a person who has a friend that told him that he was an idiot for trading. You can't win a trading, you're just gonna lose. The big player is going to take your money. You can't do it, you don't have edge, you're not going to win. It's not possible. It's impossible. It turns out this guy like to thinks that he can do sports betting. </p>
<p>I think that he has a system to win at sports betting which is a game of pure chance and it's actually rigged against you, literally rigged against you. The edge is with the house versus learning a skill like trading, which I'm not saying trading is easy. But there is absolutely skill that you can apply into the markets and make money. So you're gonna be learning the fastest and the best ways of doing this. Remember, it takes a doctor 10 years to make 10k a month. So if I tell you, it'll take you three years to make hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars as a trader, maybe five years, you should be thanking your lucky stars and бе grateful to whichever God you believe in that you have the opportunity to do that, to do something that 20 years ago was impossible. </p>
<p>When my parents were growing up, everyone wanted to be a doctor. Everyone couldn't wait to go and do their 10 years to make 10 grand a month, right? If you go into this, it will be the greatest thing that you have ever done. If you commit to it, you follow through and you complete it. You'll learn how much you actually learn in such a short period of time. But again, unfortunately, like most things in life, most people will quit. And they'll quit because they don't actually want. They don't actually want the reality of being rich. They think they want it but when it comes down to it, they clearly don't, because they opt out. </p>
<p>They reached the first hurdle. They think ''Nah, it's a bit too high'' or maybe they jumped two or three hurdles and they think ''I'm getting tired. I'm gonna go back to fucking living in my mom's basement. Eating shitty food, being a person with a life not worth living'' or whatever losers do. Because that's it, they don't want the reality of being rich, which is you go through a lot of hard work, you go through a lot of shit. But at the end of that big pile of shit, is everything that everybody else doesn't get to have.</p>
<p>You're going to be the guy or girl who is sitting there in the Lambo on the yacht. The person who looks like they're always on holiday and people are gonna ask you, how did you do it? And you're probably gonna say ''Oh, I just got lucky'' because you know that the reality if you told them will be too conflicting to them, they wouldn't believe it. If you told them ''No, I actually grinded my fucking face off to get here''. And now I enjoy the spoils of war, I get to be the rich person, I get to be the person who has everything he wants, I get to be the person who looks after his family, who retires his parents, whose kids are set for life and are able to be raised in a healthy way, free from all the bullshit of society. </p>
<p>I can opt out of all the programming that they're trying to do on me. I can choose to be who I want and live where I want to do what I want. Because as you go along you'll realize it's not about money. It's about freedom. My goal my whole life was always to get rich, yeah? So I always thought about it and as I was growing up, I was like, I want to be rich, I want to be rich, I want to be rich. Because as a kid you think very binary, you've got the posters of the supercars, and you think about all the nice holidays you can take and all this shit. But when you sit and think about it, what you actually want is freedom. Freedom to do whatever you want. </p>
<p>You do not work to become rich so you can stop working. You work to become rich, so you can work more on the things you want to do. Whether that's charity, to building businesses, building a family, raising your family. You will have time to do all of that. So that's what's gonna be. There are many things you can do to make money and there are much less intellectually stimulating. There are much tougher ways to make money, as in physically tougher, there are much more boring ways to make money. Trading is one of the most difficult areas to achieve in. </p>
<p>But when you do, you'll realize that all that extreme hard work and effort and sacrifice was not just rewarding, but it was rewarding in an industry and in an area that is stimulating and challenging to you every single day. You're not the owner of the pen factory. All very valid and great ways to make money. Sure, you build a big business, but you're not passionate about it. I don't know any trader who is not intensely passionate about the markets every day of the week. I know many failed traders who are very, very, very salty and angry at the market because they think the market failed them but it was really themselves who failed. </p>
<p>They failed themselves. I encourage everyone to watch and actually as I think it right now I'm gonna include this in the Level 1 belt system. I'm gonna include a few things for you to watch. You're gonna get a head start. Watch some documentaries about the top investors of all time and it's not about how they did it. Look at the type of people they are now. I watched one not long ago on Carl Icahn. He's in his 80s and he still wakes up every day and hustles and is intensely engaged in the markets and loves the game. </p>
<p>You can't figure the game out. Ray Dalio is in his 70s and isn't slowing down. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are in their fucking 90s and they're still doing AGM meetings with their investors. And people all over the world hang on their every word. This is what you will be involved in. This is the life that you will live if you choose to live it. You can choose to be anything you want. In this life you absolutely can choose to be anything you want but you have to put in the required work to get it. Back to my original point, proof of work, whether you do it through the program or do it live. </p>
<p>Everybody knows this. There's a reason why the proof of work system is so revolutionary and why Bitcoin has grown to what it is. You can't shortcut the work. So, Level 1 belt system does all of that. Builds your solid habits, makes you into a consistent person who then can become a consistent trader. Now, depending on your timeframe, I know this question will be on the lips of many, it doesn't matter if you have one hour a day or eight hours a day to commit to the program. The only thing that will change is your expected timeframe. That is totally fine. </p>
<p>There is nothing I love more than going into goal crushers every day and reading the spreadsheets of people who are saying that I am going to allocate one hour a day to trading because I know that I need to focus on my E-commerce store. I need to focus on my outreach for copywriting, I need to focus on my business, I need to focus on my job. Because I've stepped back and logical looked at my situation and said, No, actually, I need to get my money, I'll get my income up. So I'm going to do my one hour a day of trading. Because the worst thing you can do is zero. </p>
<p>You should be in the program doing at least one hour a day because you're learning something that in the future is going to have massive upside potential. And when I see those people, I think they are going to make it. The ultimate delay gratification is to put down the shiny object and do what you need to do. Everybody wants to be a day trader, everyone wants to be a trader. Everyone wants to make all the money in the market. Everyone wants to wake up, look at the TradingView, draw a few lines, know where price is gonna go and then just make 10 grand. </p>
<p>Everyone wants to do that. But the people who wake up and say ''Well, I've got five grand, that's not enough money, so I'm going to forget the thing I want. Instead of taking the marshmallow now Jumping in live trading with 5k, I'm going to remove money from the equation entirely and focus an hour a day, maybe two hours a day on learning through the Pro Trader Program and I'm going to go and hustle and grind to get my cash up.'' And guess what? In a few months you don't just get given the two marshmallows, you get given 20. You take those 20 marshmallows and then with the skills you've learned, with the proof of work you've shown both to yourself and the universe of your ability to delay gratification. </p>
<p>You take those 20 marshmallows and the skill you've learned and you multiply them into 100, 200, 500, 1,000. So, the path for everybody is identical. The only thing that will change is the time you need. If you have one to two hours a day, I have a plan for you. If you've got three to four hours a day, I have a plan for you. If you have full time hours, 8-10 or 12 hours a day, I have a plan for you. You can pass that and then move on to Level 2 belt. </p>
<p>Level 2 belt is where you develop winning systems. The path to millions as a trader is first building consistency, consistency as a person and as a mechanical trader. The act of trading. You then move on to the next step of developing winning systems. This is where you trade live. This is where you collect data. This is where you find what works. This is where you analyze and improve. This is where you take on the challenge. This is where you take on the perfect loser. This is where you find your identified setups. This is where you start to develop your character. </p>
<p>Your own little niche as a trader, you figure out who you are as a trader because not everyone is the same. What works for me doesn't work for George and vice versa. From Level 2 belt, if you put in the work and you show that. You give me the proof of work, then you get given a Level 3 belt and you move up. Level 3 belt is where things start to get exponentially greater. This is where we begin to increase size and to show you specific tips and strategies of how to develop a list of setups. You learn many things and then you combine them into multiple setups that allow you to take trades in any market environment on any asset and most importantly understanding when to trade and how to trade at the right times. </p>
<p>This is where you develop, not just understanding of what trades are, not just trade setups, but grading your setups. This is where you develop your A+ trade setups as well as A ,your B and your C and your D. This is where you refine your edge. This is where you cement your style. Are you a trend trader or mean reversion trader? Are you a scalper, day trader, swing trader or position trader? Are you a hybrid combination of all of them, which most people will be? Here is where you skill stack. This is the most important part of the process of being a Level 3 belt. </p>
<p>You stack skills. You have learned about psychology, you've learned about risk management, you've learned about execution. You've learned about technical analysis, you've learned about how to use indicators. You've learned about how to view the macro economy, you've learned about all various factors that go into markets. This is where you stack your skills. This is where you become an expert in two or more skills, which when combined, puts you ahead of 90% of the population. I will showing you bet sizing techniques that allow you to consistently grow your portfolio. Once you've proven that work, you progressed to Level 3 belt. </p>
<p>In Level 3 belt, this is where you go from being someone who is increasing their size. Learning how to put real money on the line, but maybe not always making money, tweaking, figuring out working out the kinks in system that's Level 3 belt. In Level 4 Belt, this is where you become a consistently profitable trader, meaning somebody who can actually sit down and say, Yes, over time, I have systems that always make money in the long run. Whether the markets up, down or sideways, I know how to trade it best for my style, for my personality, for my current position in life.</p>
<p>In here, you'll learn exponential bet sizing, you'll learn about dynamic AV, and many more advanced strategies. As well as very specific group calls with me about the intricacies of advanced training. Things that if I said them to you right now would not make sense. So they're not worth saying. I don't say that to talk down on anyone. It's just not a useful metric or not a useful topic to discuss until you have gone through the Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 belts. Remember, you can't shortcut the process. You can go fast, you can be the fastest student that has ever been in the program to reach Level 4 Belt. </p>
<p>But you must have done the work along the way and proven it and from there from Level 4 belt for being consistently profitable. You can progress. Once you've shown all the things I mentioned above, you can be granted a Level 5 Belt. What happens inside there will be revealed later. So that is the Pro Trader Program. If you can see this message that means you are welcome to join, but I do not want people who won't put in the work. </p> 




You are free to join. You're free to quit. Do whatever you wish. That is your journey at the end of the day. It's not my journey. I'm here to help. 
I'm putting all this together to help you, not to help me and I want everyone to win. But you must be willing to work hard. You want something you've never had, you have to do something you've never done. So, that's it. The Pro Trader Program launches Thursday. Be here. Be ready.
