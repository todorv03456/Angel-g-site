<p>Welcome to the The ProTrader Program. </p>
<p>In a moment, you'll be given the opportunity to either opt-in or opt out of the program. Your next decision is potentially the most important of your entire trading life.This is a practical program where I take you through the Trading Lessons in the best order:</p>
<p>Before you do, I need to tell you something. You've seen from being in the site, the wealth of knowledge available to you. Hundreds of lessons, teaching you everything you could want to know about trading all the way from the basics, through technical analysis, how to master your mindset and psychology, indicators, data and how to put it all together into a system. </p>
<p>There's more information here than you could possibly go through, even in many, many months. The ProTrader Program is designed to take you step by step all the way from wherever you are now to the massive success that you want to have. Whatever success means for you, The ProTrader Program is your best way to reach it. It doesn't matter if you're on day one of your trading journey or day 1000. This program is designed to make you a better person as well as a better trader who can kill it in the markets. </p>
<p>I need to tell you something. You are at a critical point not just in your trading life, but in your life in general. The next 12 to 24 months will define your future. You're involved in crypto because you want to catch big moves in a bull run, you want to make money, you want to set yourself up, you want to be financially free. Everybody who comes into crypto has the same goal.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to get rich. The difference between those who make it and those who don't is the steps they take and the work they're willing to put in. I'm here to tell you, you absolutely must have a plan. And you must commit to a long term vision. You're not gonna get rich in a month. You're not gonna get rich in three months. You may very well get rich in the next one to three years if you play it right.</p>
<p>There will come a time whenever everything is going crazy when prices are going up. Seemingly every day, everyone's rich on paper. But guess what? The people who caught the 100x or 1,000x, meme coins, NFTs, all that shit in the last cycle. Most of them don't have that money anymore. It's not about making it, it's about keeping it. That's what separates the true winners from the losers.</p>
<p>What you will learn inside the program if you choose to opt in is an exact step by step program that will take you all the way to Level 5 (Black Belt) where you become a master of your systems. And you'll learn to make money profitably in the markets on a consistent basis. But the path to get there is not easy. The skill you are going to learn is not a flash in the pan, it is not an easy come easy go skill. It is not a fad. </p>
<p>Financial markets have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years and they will still be around hundreds of years from now. What you're learning is truly a skill for life. But you must treat it as such. You do not need to make money in one month, three months, six months. Imagine you learned a skill that when properly crafted allows you to print money consistently over time for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>Whether that be millions of dollars as a full time trader or even just supplementing your income as a part time trader who consistently knows how to manage their wealth. But here's the reality, most people are losers and quitters. 90% of people lose money in the markets. To be in the 10% you have to do the things that the people in the 90% are unwilling to do. That is hard work, patience and discipline.</p>
<p>Inside The Pro Trader Program you will find all the lessons and more that are currently in the Trading Lessons within the site. But there's going to be a program given to you that is the fastest and best way to learn what you need to learn to become the trader you want to be so that you can command your own destiny in the market. It takes 10 years for a doctor to get to the point where he can make 10k a month.</p>
<p>The old way is dead. The things you thought growing up, the dream jobs, the ways to make money, the ways to get ahead in the world. That's not the way of the world anymore. If done correctly, this will be the greatest thing you've ever done and you will learn so much not just about the markets but about yourself. You will realize how hard you can truly work. You will learn that you can be a person who sets goals, and consistently crushes them. You will find out things you never even knew about yourself. </p>
<p>You will become unstoppable in all areas of life If you apply this correctly and you take the steps necessary. But I must warn you, most people will quit because they don't want the reality of what it means to be rich. When you see that guy on his yacht, or driving his Lambo or flying in private jets, always on holiday, always looking like he's living the life. It's easy to think ''that guy's lucky. But he must have had all the bricks, he must have had rich parents.'' Whatever these negative scarcity mindset thoughts that creep into your head tell you.</p>
<p>The reality behind every really rich person who has built their wealth is that they applied themselves with pure focus, discipline and dedication for years to get to where they are. Those billionaires on yachts are usually 40, 50 or 60 years old. They have grinded since they were 18. Even the young guys you see who have a lot of money. Yes, some of them have quick money. Maybe they caught a pump in the last Bull Run, but they won't be around for long. Most of the of them have been grinding online for many years. You don't see the work that goes on, you only see the end result. </p>
<p>There's a reason why the top traders are so admired. There's reason why all the best investors of all time have documentaries, books and movies written about them. They have access to something that the average person does not have. They are able to accurately forecast not just markets but full cycles, entire cycles of human emotion. They understand the fear and greed and use it to their advantage. They make money because they understand themselves. They understand the process and they commit to it.</p>
<p>The ProTrader Program will teach you this. It will not be easy, but for those who make it, it will change your life. There are five stages. Everybody starts as a Level 1 (White Belt). With this belt your goal is not to get rich, it is to prove consistency. There are tasks you must do and complete every day, every week. There are quizzes along the way you must pass and the core theme behind all of The ProTrader Program much like Bitcoin is proof of work. Nothing will be handed to you. To progress through the program you must be given a belt.</p>
<p>You must be upgraded, you must be handed that belt by me and me alone. To do so, I must see that you have done the work, you must complete the challenges. You must submit the work, You must build the systems, you must do the tests, and you must show the work you have done to progress. All along the way. You have support, you have exclusive access to me, special lessons, chats, questions, channels, and feedback in real-time. Everything you could ever need. But at the end of the day you have to prove that you are ready to step up.</p>
<p>After Level 1 (White Belt) when you pass, you will be promoted to Level 2 (Blue Belt). This is where you take your learnings and build upon them. This is where you start to develop winning systems. You trade live, you collect data, you analyze and improve. You complete two major challenges and much more. The next stage is the Level 3 (Purple Belt). This is where the magic starts to happen.</p>
<p>This is where you stack your skills to become an elite trader. This is where you start to increase size. Develop a list of setups to understand what a really great trade is for you and what trades to avoid. This is where you refine your style and your edge. Once you've proven that you've reached the appropriate level, you will be promoted to Level 4 (Brown Belt), as a Level 4, you are now a consistently profitable trader.</p>
<p>I'm going to show you advanced techniques of how to scale that. Making money is one thing, making money on an exponential curve is another. You will learn about exponential bet sizing, dynamic EV, advanced strategies and ways to express your edge in the market differently to accumulate greater wealth and compound your portfolio. And finally, should you reach it, you will be promoted to the coveted Level 5 (Black Belt) roll the details of which will be revealed only to those inside. </p>
<p>But as always with everything in life, you must start at the bottom, start at the beginning. In a moment you will be given an opportunity to opt in. Only committed students may apply. When you join the burden of performance is on you and you alone. I want to do everything I can to help you. But I am not going to hold your hand. I'm not going to bring along any passengers.</p>
<p>I'm only bringing along hardworking, diligent and dedicated students. If you choose to do this, you will not recognize yourself one year from now. You will have upgraded your life in every single way possible. This goes way beyond trading. You can be the master of your own destiny If you play this right. And you can be a master of the market if you apply what you're about to find out. So think hard before you click submit. Do NOT join this on a whim. If you enter and you leave that is on you. If you're ready to join, I'll see you inside. </p>
